              <h1>Why I Started Learning Code</h1>
              
              <strong><small>I started learning how to code very recently and on my own.</small></strong>
                  <p>Building PC's for myself and a few friends is what really got me interested in coding. I enjoyed every second of building them and want to build more. The time i spent learning about all the differnt types of code was spent on Code Academy and Youtube, i soon relized i would need more guidance. After a couple failed attempts at making my own web page, I joined Coding Temple. I know i have a lot to learn but im so happy to have a web page built, even if it is a bit ugly. 
              Im really looking forward to learning more and being able to make a amazing web page on my own. 
                  </p>

              <h1>Chess</h1>
                <strong><small>How to win chess</small></strong>
                <p>There is no easy way to win a game of chess. But that’s only if by “winning” you mean hunting down your opponent’s king until he is gasping for air in a solitary corner, his vision fading into the black and white static of the board as your opponent 
                  commits seppuku by resignation. Only gradually will you return to the hard seats and smudged tabletop of your parks rest area. Looking around at the trees,and hearing the birds sing, you'll blink in a daze at the face of your opponent who, you must remember, is your friend in real life.</p>
